# FivemDiscordPerms
## About
This project was started by Badger in March of 2020 in response to Discord disabling 
Fivem's API requests utilizing the RPC method they used without Discord's permission.
Many fivem servers used the discord features in script and it made life so much 
easier... FivemDiscordPerms aims to bring back that ease again, however has
a workaround to getting users' discords.

## How it works?
Essentially, FivemDiscordPerms has a database in which holds the information of players
who join your server. You run this website along with the database and fivem script.
When a player joins and does not have a database account, they will be instructed
to create one as soon as they spawn in the server. We also have the option of running
this website publicly for all to use, but this may cause rate-limiting, so it may be
a better idea for you to run it individually for your servers only. However, in case
you want the publicly available version (no setup required besides the Fivem script),
you can find that further below including more information.
